<p class="center"><big>DIVERSIONS OF THE RE-ECHO CLUB</big></p>


<p><span class="dcap">A</span> recent discovery has brought to light the long-hidden papers of the
Re-Echo Club. This is a great find, and all lovers of masterpieces of
the world's best literature will rejoice with us that we are enabled to
publish herewith a few of these gems of great minds. Little is known of
the locale or client&egrave;le of this club, but it was doubtless a successor
of the famous Echo Club of Boston memory, for, like that erudite body,
it takes pleasure in trying to better what is done. On the occasion of
the meeting of which the following gems of poesy are the result, the
several members of the club engaged to write up the well-known tradition
of the Purple Cow in more elaborate form than the quatrain made famous
by Mr. Gelett Burgess:</p>
<p class="poem">
"I never saw a Purple Cow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I never hope to see one;</span><br />
But I can tell you, anyhow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd rather see than be one."</span><br />
</p>
<p>The first attempt here cited is the production of Mr. John Milton:</p>
<p class="poem">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>Hence, vain, deluding cows.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The herd of folly, without color bright,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How little you delight,</span><br />
Or fill the Poet's mind, or songs arouse!<br />
But, hail! thou goddess gay of feature!<br />
Hail! divinest purple creature!<br />
Oh, Cow, thy visage is too bright<br />
To hit the sense of human sight.<br />
And though I'd like, just once, to see thee,<br />
I never, never, never'd be thee!<br />
</p>

<p class="author">MR. P. BYSSHE SHELLEY:</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hail to thee, blithe spirit!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Cow thou never wert;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">But in life to cheer it</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Playest thy full part</span><br />
In purple lines of unpremeditated art.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The pale purple color</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Melts around thy sight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Like a star, but duller,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">In the broad daylight.</span><br />
I'd see thee, but I would not be thee if I might.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">We look before and after</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">At cattle as they browse;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Our most hearty laughter</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Something sad must rouse.</span><br />
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of Purple Cows.<br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p><p class="author">MR. W. WORDSWORTH:</p>
<p class="poem">
She dwelt among the untrodden ways<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Beside the springs of Dee;</span><br />
A Cow whom there were few to praise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And very few to see.</span><br />
A violet by a mossy stone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Greeting the smiling East</span><br />
Is not so purple, I must own,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As that erratic beast.</span><br />
She lived unknown, that Cow, and so<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I never chanced to see;</span><br />
But if I had to be one, oh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The difference to me!</span><br />
</p>

<p class="author">MR. T. GRAY:</p>
<p class="poem">
The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea;</span><br />
I watched them slowly wend their weary way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, ah, a Purple Cow I did not see.</span><br />
<br />
Full many a cow of purplest ray serene<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is haply grazing where I may not see;</span><br />
Full many a donkey writes of her, I ween,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But neither of these creatures would I be.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="author">MR. J. W. RILEY:</p>
<p class="poem">
There, little Cow, don't cry!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You are brindle and brown, I know.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And with wild, glad hues</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of reds and blues,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">You never will gleam and glow.</span><br />
But though not pleasing to the eye,<br />
There, little Cow, don't cry, don't cry.<br />
</p>

<p class="author">LORD A. TENNYSON:</p>
<p class="poem">
Ask me no more. A cow I fain would see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of purple tint, like to a sun-soaked grape&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of purple tint, like royal velvet cape&mdash;</span><br />
But such a creature I would never be&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Ask me no more.</span><br />

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">All that I know</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Of a certain Cow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Is it can throw,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Somewhere, somehow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Now a dart of red,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Now a dart of blue</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(That makes purple, 'tis said).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">I would fain see, too,</span><br />
This Cow that darkles the red and the blue!<br />
</p>

<p class="author">MR. J. KEATS:</p>
<p class="poem">
A cow of purple is a joy forever.<br />
Its loveliness increases. I have never<br />
Seen this phenomenon. Yet ever keep<br />
A brave lookout; lest I should be asleep<br />
When she comes by. For, though I would not be one,<br />
I've oft imagined 'twould be joy to see one.<br />

The Purple Cow strayed in the glade;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Oh, my soul! but the milk is blue!)</span><br />
She strayed and strayed and strayed and strayed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And I wail and I cry Wa-hoo!)</span><br />
<br />
I've never seen her&mdash;nay, not I;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Oh, my soul! but the milk is blue!)</span><br />
Yet were I that Cow I should want to die.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And I wail and I cry Wa-hoo!)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But in vain my tears I strew.</span><br />

<p class="author">MR. T.B. ALDRICH:</p>
<p class="poem">
Somewhere in some faked nature place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Wonderland, in Nonsense Land,</span><br />
Two darkling shapes met face to face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bade each other stand.</span><br />
<br />
"And who are you?" said each to each;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Tell me your title, anyhow."</span><br />
One said, "I am the Papal Bull,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And I the Purple Cow."</span><br />
</p>

<p class="author">MR. E. ALLAN POE:</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Open then I flung a shutter,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, with many a flirt and flutter,</span><br />
In there stepped a Purple Cow which gayly tripped around my floor.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Not the least obeisance made she,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Not a moment stopped or stayed she,</span><br />
But with mien of chorus lady perched herself above my door.<br />
On a dusty bust of Dante perched and sat above my door.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And that Purple Cow unflitting</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Still is sitting&mdash;still is sitting</span><br />
On that dusty bust of Dante just above my chamber door,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And her horns have all the seeming</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of a demon's that is screaming,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the arc-light o'er her streaming</span><br />
Casts her shadow on the floor.<br />
And my soul from out that pool of Purple Shadow on the floor<br />
Shall be lifted Nevermore!<br />

<p class="poem">
The day is done, and the darkness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Falls from the wing of night</span><br />
As ballast is wafted downward<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From an air-ship in its flight.</span><br />
<br />
I dream of a purple creature<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which is not as kine are now;</span><br />
And resembles cattle only<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As Cowper resembles a cow.</span><br />
<br />
Such cows have power to quiet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our restless thoughts and rude;</span><br />
They come like the Benedictine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That follows after food.</span><br />

<p class="poem">
Oh, Cow of rare rapturous vision,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, purple, impalpable Cow,</span><br />
Do you browse in a Dream Field Elysian,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are you purpling pleasantly now?</span><br />
By the side of wan waves do you languish?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or in the lithe lush of the grove?</span><br />
While vainly I search in my anguish,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O Bovine of mauve!</span><br />
<br />
Despair in my bosom is sighing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hope's star has sunk sadly to rest;</span><br />
Though cows of rare sorts I am buying,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not one breathes a balm to my breast.</span><br />
Oh, rapturous rose-crowned occasion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I such a glory might see!</span><br />
But a cow of a purple persuasion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I never would be.</span><br />

I'd love to see<br />

Oh, Goodness me!<br />
I'd love to see<br />
But not to be<br />

I'd love to see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A Purple Cow.</span><br />

Now the joys of the road are chiefly these,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>A Purple Cow that no one sees,<br />
A grove of green and a sky of blue,<br />
And never a hope that cow to view.<br />
But a firm conviction deep in me<br />
That cow I would rather be than see.<br />
Though, alack-a-day, there be times enow,<br />
When I see pink snakes and a Purple Cow.<br />

<p class="author">MR. H.C. BUNNER:</p>
<p class="poem">
Oh, what's the way to Arcady,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where all the cows are purple?</span><br />
Ah, woe is me! I never hope<br />
On such a sight my eyes to ope;<br />
But, as I sing in merry glee<br />
Along the road to Arcady,<br />
Perchance full soon I may espy<br />
A Purple Cow come dancing by.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heigho! I then shall see one.</span><br />
Her horns bedecked with ribbons gay,<br />
And garlanded with rosy may,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A tricksy sight. Still I must say</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd rather see than be one.</span><br />

In winter I get up at night<br />
And hunt that cow by lantern light;<br />
In summer quite the other way,<br />
I seek a Purple Cow by day.<br />
And does it not seem strange to you,<br />
I can't find cows of purple hue?<br />
But I can tell you, anyhow,<br />
I'm glad I'm not a Purple Cow.<br />

There's a Purple Cow a-settin'<br />
And I know she thinks of me.<br />
For the wind is in the gum-tree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the hay is in the mow,</span><br />
And the cow-bells are a-calling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Come and see a Purple Cow!"</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I am not going now,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not at present, anyhow,</span><br />
For I am not fond of purple, and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I can't abide a cow;</span><br />
No, I shall not go to-day,<br />
Where the Purple Cattle play,<br />
Though I think I'd rather see one<br />

Once a man said,<br />

Again he spoke,<br />
I never hope to see one.<br />
Then all the people said,<br />
How noble his humble-mindedness!<br />
How glorious his meek resignation!<br />
Now this is the strange part&mdash;<br />
The man has seen hundreds of purple cows,<br />

The blessed Purple Cow leaned out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From a pasture lot at even</span><br />
One horn was sixteen inches long,<br />

She had a ruminative face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the teeth in her head were seven.</span><br />
She gazed and listened, then she said<br />

"Nobody seems to notice me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">None knows that I am here.</span><br />

<p><span class="dcap">A</span>t the second meeting of the Re-Echo Club, some of whose proceedings
have already been chronicled in these pages, the question arose whether
the poet was at his best who gave to the world the classic poem about
The Little Girl:</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"There was a little girl</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And she had a little curl</span><br />
Right in the middle of her forehead.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And when she was good,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She was very, very good,</span><br />
And when she was bad she was horrid!"<br />
</p>
<p>Some members held that poets had at times risen to sublimer poetic
flights than this, while others contended that the clear-cut decision of
thought it expressed placed the poem above more elaborate works.</p>

<p>When those who criticised it were invited themselves to treat the same
theme in more worthy fashion, they willingly enough agreed, and the
results here subjoined were spread upon the minutes of the club.</p>

<p>With a lady-like air of reserve tempered by self-respect, Mrs. Felicia
Hemans presented her version:</p>
<p class="poem">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>The Marcel waves dash'd high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the puffs and frizzes crossed;</span><br />
And just above a roguish eye<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A little curl was tossed.</span><br />
<br />
And that little curl hung down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er a brow like a holy saint;</span><br />
Her goodness was beyond renown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet&mdash;there was a taint.</span><br />
<br />
Ay, call it deadly sin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The temper that she had;</span><br />
But that Little Girl just gloried in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Freedom to be real bad!</span><br />
</p>
<p>Robert Browning gave the subject much thought and responded at length:</p>
<p class="poem">
Who will may hear the poet's story told.<br />
His story? Who believes me shall behold<br />
The Little Girl, tricked out with ringolet,<br />
Or fringe, or pompadour, or what you will,<br />
Switch, bang, rat, puff&mdash;odzooks, man! I know not<br />
What women call the hanks o' hair they wear!<br />
But that same curl, beau-catcher, love-lock, frizz.<br />
(Perchance hot-ironed&mdash;perchance 'twas bandolined;<br />
Mayhap those rubber squirmers gave it shape&mdash;<br />
I wot not.) But that corkscrew of a curl<br />
Hung plumb, true, straight, accurate, at mid-brow,<br />
Nor swerved a hair's breadth to the right or left.<br />
Aught of her other tresses none may know.<br />
Now go we straitly on. And undertake<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>To sound the humor of the Little Girl.<br />
Ha! what's the note? Hark here. When she was good,<br />
She was seraphic; hypersuperfine.<br />
So good she made the saints seem scalawags;<br />
An angel child; a paramaragon.<br />
Halt! Turn! When she elected to be bad,<br />
Black fails to paint the depths of ignomin,<br />
The fearsome sins, the crimes unspeakable,<br />
The deep abysses of her evilment.<br />
Hist! Tell 't wi' bated breath! One day she let<br />
A rosy tongue-tip from red lips peep forth!<br />
Can viciousness cap that? Horrid's the word.<br />
Yet there she is. There is that Little Girl,<br />
Her goodness and her badness, side by side,<br />
Like bacon, streak o' fat and streak o' lean.<br />
Ah, Fatalist, she must be ever so.<br />
</p>
<p>Mr. E.A. Poe declared that he wrote his lines without any trouble at
all, as he used to know the Little Girl personally:</p>
<p class="poem">
'Twas not very many years ago,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At Seahurst-By-The-Sea,</span><br />
A little girl had a little curl&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her name was Annabel Lee.</span><br />
And right in the middle of Annabel's brow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That curl would always be.</span><br />
<br />
She was so good, oh, she was so good<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At Seahurst-By-The-Sea!</span><br />
She was good with a goodness more than good,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was beautiful Annabel Lee,</span><br />
With such goodness the winged seraphs of heaven<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Coveted her of me.</span><br />
But her badness was stronger by far than the good,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like many far older than she,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like many far wiser than she;</span><br />
And neither the angels in heaven above<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor the demons down under the sea</span><br />
Can ever dissever the good from the bad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the soul of Annabel Lee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The beautiful Annabel Lee.</span><br />
</p>
<p>Then Mr. Stevenson went out into his own garden and plucked this:</p>
<p class="poem">
In winter, I go up at night<br />
And curl that curl by candle-light;<br />
In summer, quite the other way,<br />
I have to curl it twice a day.<br />
<br />
When I am good, I seem to be<br />
As good as peaches on the tree;<br />
But when I'm bad I've awful ways,<br />
I'm horrid, everybody says.<br />
<br />
And does it not seem hard to you,<br />
I have to choose between the two?<br />
When I'm not happy, good and glad,<br />
I have to be so awful bad!<br />
</p>
<p>Mr. Kipling took a real interest in the work and produced the following:</p>
<p class="poem">
"What is the gas-stove going for?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Asked Files-On-Parade.</span><br />
"To curl my hair, to curl my hair?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His Little Sister said.</span><br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>"What makes you curl so tight, so tight?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Asked Files-On-Parade.</span><br />
"I'm thinkin' 'twill be damp to-night,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His Little Sister said.</span><br />
<br />
"For you know that when I'm good, I'm just as good as I can be.<br />
And when I'm bad, there's nobody can be as bad as me.<br />
So I'm thinkin' I'll be very good to-night, because, you see,<br />
I'm thinkin' I'll be horrid in the morning."<br />
</p>
<p>Mr. Hood was in a reminiscent mood, so he looked backward:</p>
<p class="poem">
I remember, I remember,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That curl I used to wear;</span><br />
It cost a dollar ninety-eight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(It was the best of hair).</span><br />
It always stayed right in its place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It never went astray;</span><br />
But now, I sometimes wish the wind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had blown that curl away.</span><br />
<br />
I remember, I remember,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How good I used to be;</span><br />
Why, St. Cecelia at her best<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was not as good as me.</span><br />
I never tore my pinafore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or got my slippers wet;</span><br />
I let my brother steal my cake&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That boy is living yet!</span><br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>I remember, I remember,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How bad I've sometimes been;</span><br />
How all my little childish tricks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were counted fearful sin.</span><br />
I'm glad I cut up, anyway,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But still 'tis little joy</span><br />
To know I could have played worse pranks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If I had been a boy.</span><br />
</p>
<p>Mr. Wordsworth took it quietly:</p>
<p class="poem">
I met a gentle Little Girl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She was sixteen years, <i>she said</i>;</span><br />
Her hair was thick; that same old curl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was hanging from her head.</span><br />
<br />
"You're very, very good, you say;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And you look good to me,</span><br />
Yet you are bad. Tell me, I pray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet maid, how that may be?"</span><br />
<br />
Then did the Little Girl reply<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(The curl bobbed on her forehead),</span><br />
"When I am good, I'm good as pie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when I'm bad, I'm horrid."</span><br />
</p>


<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>
<p><span class="dcap">A</span>t the next meeting of the Re-Echo Club there was achieved a
vindication of the limerick. "It has been said," remarked the President
of the Re-Echo Club, "by ignorant and undiscerning would-be critics that
the Limerick is not among the classic and best forms of poetry, and,
indeed, some have gone so far as to say that it is not poetry at all.</p>

<p>"A brief consideration of its claims to pre&euml;minence among recognized
forms of verse will soon convince any intelligent reader of its
superlative worth and beauty.</p>

<p>"As a proof of this, let us consider the following Limerick, which in
the opinion of connoisseurs is the best one ever written:</p>
<p class="poem">
There was a young lady of Niger,<br />
Who smiled as she rode on a tiger;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They came back from the ride</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With the lady inside,</span><br />
And the smile on the face of the tiger.<br />
</p>
<p>Now let us compare this exquisite bit of real poesy with what Chaucer
has written on the same theme:</p>
<p class="poem">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>A mayde ther ben, in Niger born and bredde;<br />
Hire merye smyle went neere aboute hire hedde.<br />
Uponne a beeste shee rood, a tyger gaye,<br />
And sikerly shee laughen on hire waye.<br />
<br />
Anon, as it bifel, bak from the ryde<br />
Ther came, his sadel hangen doone bisyde,<br />
The tyger. On his countenaunce the whyle<br />
Ther ben behelde a gladnesse and a smyle.<br />
</p>
<p>Again, Austin Dobson chose to throw off the thing in triolet form:</p>
<p class="poem">
She went for a ride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That young lady of Niger;</span><br />
Her smile was quite wide<br />
As she went for a ride;<br />
But she came back inside,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the smile on the tiger!</span><br />
She <i>went</i> for a ride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That young lady of Niger.</span><br />
</p>
<p>Rossetti, with his inability to refrain from refrains, turned out this:</p>
<p class="poem">
In Niger dwelt a lady fair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Bacon and eggs and a bar o' soap!)</span><br />
Who smiled 'neath tangles of her hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As her steed began his steady lope.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(You like this style, I hope!)</span><br />
<br />
On and on they sped and on,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Bacon and eggs and a bar o' soap!)</span><br />
On and on and on and on;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(You see I've not much scope.)</span><br />
<br />
E'en ere they loped the second mile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tiger 'gan his mouth to ope;</span><br />
Anon he halted for a while;<br />
Then went on with a pleasant smile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Bacon and eggs and a bar o' soap!)</span><br />
</p>
<p>Omar looked at the situation philosophically, and summed up his views in
such characteristic lines as these.</p>
<p class="poem">
Why if the Soul can fling the Dust aside<br />
And, smiling, on a Tiger blithely ride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were't not a Shame&mdash;were't not a Shame for him</span><br />
In stupid Niger tamely to abide?<br />
<br />
Strange, is it not? that, of the Myriads who<br />
Before us rode the Sandy Desert through,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not one returns to tell us of the Road</span><br />
Which to discover we ride smiling, too.<br />
<br />
We are no other than a moving Row<br />
Of Magic Niger-shapes that come and go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Round with the Smile-illumined Tiger held</span><br />
In Midnight by the Master of the Show.<br />
</p>
<p>Tennyson saw a dramatic opportunity, and gloried in his chance, thus:</p>
<p class="poem">
Half a league, half a league,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the big tiger,</span><br />
Rode with a smiling face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lady of Niger.</span><br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>Mad rushed the noble steed,<br />
Smiled she and took no heed;<br />
Smiled at the breakneck speed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the big tiger.</span><br />
<br />
Boldly they plunged and swayed,<br />
Fearlessly and unafraid,&mdash;<br />
Tiger and lovely maid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fair and beguiling;</span><br />
Flash'd she her sunny smiles,<br />
Flash'd o'er the sunlit miles;<br />
Then they rode back, but not&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not the same smiling!</span><br />
<br />
When can their glory fade?<br />
O the wild charge they made,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Riding from Niger!</span><br />
Honor the ride they made!<br />
Honor the smiles displayed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lady and Tiger!</span><br />
</p>
<p>Kipling, of course, seized the theme for a fine and stirring
Barrack-Room Ballad:</p>
<p class="poem">
"What is the lady smiling for?"<br />
Said Files-On-Parade.<br />
"She's going for a tiger ride,"<br />
The Color-Sergeant said;<br />
"What makes her smile so gay, so gay?"<br />
Said Files-On-Parade;<br />
"She likes to go for tiger rides,"<br />
The Color-Sergeant said.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>"For she's riding on the tiger, you can see his stately stride;<br />
When they're returning home again, she'll take a place inside;<br />
And on the tiger's face will be the smile so bland and wide,<br />
But she's riding on the tiger in the morning."<br />
</p>
<p>Browning was pleased with the subject and did the best he could with it,
along these lines:</p>


<p class="author">THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER:</p>
<p class="poem">
(The Tiger speaks.)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I said, "Then, Dearest, since 'tis so,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since now at length your fate you know,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since nothing all your smile avails,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since all your life seems meant for fails,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Henceforth you ride inside."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who knows what's best? Ah, who can tell?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I loved the lady. Therefore,&mdash;well,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I shuddered. Yet it had to be.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so together, I and she</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ride, ride, forever ride.</span><br />
</p>
<p>Swinburne spread himself thusly:</p>
<p class="poem">
O marvellous, mystical maiden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the way of the wind on the wing;</span><br />
Low laughter thy lithe lips hath laden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy smile is a Song of the Spring.</span><br />
O typical, tropical tiger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With wicked and wheedlesome wiles;</span><br />
O lovely lost lady of Niger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our Lady of Smiles.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p><p>Edgar Allan Poe put it this way:</p>
<p class="poem">
See the lady with a smile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Sunny smile!</span><br />
Hear her gaysome, gleesome giggle as she rides around in style!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How the merry laughter trips</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From her red and rosy lips,</span><br />
As she smiles, smiles, smiles, smiles, smiles, smiles, smiles,<br />
While she rides along the dusty, desert miles.<br />
<br />
See the tiger with a smile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Happy smile!</span><br />
If such a smile means happiness, he's happy quite a pile;<br />
How contentedly he chuckles as he trots along the miles.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, he doesn't growl or groan</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he ambles on alone,</span><br />
But he smiles, smiles, smiles, smiles, smiles, smiles, smiles,<br />
As he homeward goes along the desert miles.<br />
</p>
<p>And Longfellow gave it his beautiful and clever "Hiawatha" setting:</p>
<p class="poem">
Oh, the fair and lovely lady;<br />
Oh, the sweet and winsome lady;<br />
With a smile of gentle goodness<br />
Like the lovely Laughing Water.<br />
Oh, the day the lovely lady<br />
Went to ride upon a tiger.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>Came the tiger, back returning,<br />
Homeward through the dusky twilight;<br />
Ever slower, slower, slower,<br />
Walked the tiger o'er the landscape;<br />
Ever wider, wider, wider,<br />
Spread the smile o'er all his features.<br />
</p>
<p>"And so," said the President, "after numerous examples and careful
consideration of this matter, we are led to the conclusion that for
certain propositions the Limerick is the best and indeed the only proper
vehicle of expression."</p>

<p>She luminously wavered, and I tentatively inferred that she would soon
perfectly reconsider her not altogether unobvious course. Furiously,
tho' with a tender, ebbing similitude, across her mental consciousness
stole a reculmination of all the truths she had ever known concerning,
or even remotely relating to, the not easily fathomed qualities of paste
and ink. So she stood, focused in an intensity of soul-quivers, and I,
all unrelenting, waited, though of a dim uncertainty whether, after all,
it might not be only a dubitant problem.</p>

<p><span class="dcap">P</span>erhaps one of the most enjoyable occasions was the night when the
members of the Re-Echo Club discussed the merits of the classic poem:</p>
<p class="poem">
Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater,<br />
Had a wife and couldn't keep her;<br />
Put her in a pumpkin shell,<br />
And there he kept her very well.<br />
</p>
<p>In many ways this historic narrative called forth admiration. One must
admit Peter's great strength of character, his power of quick decision,
and immediate achievement. Some held that his inability to retain the
lady's affection in the first place argued a defect in his nature; but
remembering the lady's youth and beauty (implied by the spirit of the
whole poem), they could only reiterate their appreciation of the way he
conquered circumstances, and proved himself master of his fate, and
captain of his soul! Truly, the Pumpkin-Eaters must have been a forceful
race, able to defend their rights and rule their people.</p>

<p>The Poets at their symposium unanimously felt that the style of the
poem, though hardly to be called crude, was a little bare, and they took
up with pleasure the somewhat arduous task of rewriting it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mr. Ed Poe opined that there was lack of atmosphere, and that the facts
of the narrative called for a more impressive setting. He therefore
offered:</p>
<p class="poem">
The skies, they were ashen and sober,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lady was shivering with fear;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her shoulders were shud'ring with fear,</span><br />
On a dark night in dismal October,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of his most Matrimonial Year.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was hard by the cornfield of Auber,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the musty Mud Meadows of Weir,</span><br />
Down by the dank frog-pond of Auber,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the ghoul-haunted cornfield of Weir.</span><br />
<br />
Now, his wife had a temper Satanic,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when Peter roamed here with his Soul,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the corn with his conjugal Soul,</span><br />
He spied a huge pumpkin Titanic,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he popped her right in through a hole.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then solemnly sealed up the hole.</span><br />
<br />
And thus Peter Peter has kept her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Immured in Mausoleum gloom,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A moist, humid, damp sort of gloom.</span><br />
And, though there's no doubt he bewept her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She is still in her yellow-hued tomb,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her unhallowed, Hallowe'en tomb</span><br />
And ever since Peter side-stepped her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He calls her his lost Lulalume,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His Pumpkin-entombed Lulalume.</span><br />
</p>
<p>This was received with acclaim, but many objected to the mortuary
theory.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mrs. Robert Browning was sure that Peter's love for his wife, though
perhaps that of a primitive man, was of the true Portuguese stamp, and
with this view composed the following pleasing Sonnet:</p>
<p class="poem">
How do I keep thee? Let me count the ways.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>I bar up every breadth and depth and height<br />
My hands can reach, while feeling out of sight<br />
For bolts that stick and hasps that will not raise.<br />
I keep thee from the public's idle gaze,<br />
I keep thee in, by sun or candle light.<br />
I keep thee, rude, as women strive for Right.<br />
I keep thee boldly, as they seek for praise,<br />
I keep thee with more effort than I'd use<br />
To keep a dry-goods shop or big hotel.<br />
I keep thee with a power I seemed to lose<br />
With that last cook. I'll keep thee down the well,<br />
Or up the chimney-place! Or if I choose,<br />
I shall but keep thee in a Pumpkin shell.<br />
</p>
<p>This was, of course, meritorious, though somewhat suggestive of the
cave-men, who, we have never been told, were Pumpkin Eaters.</p>

<p class="author">BALLADE OF A PUMPKIN:</p>
<p class="poem">
Golden-skinned, delicate, bright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wondrous of texture and hue,</span><br />
Bathed in a soft, sunny light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pearled with a silvery dew.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fair as a flower to the view,</span><br />
Ripened by summer's soft heat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Basking beneath Heaven's blue,&mdash;</span><br />
This is the Pumpkin of Pete.<br />
<br />
Peter consumed day and night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pumpkin in pie or in stew;</span><br />
Hinted to Cook that she might<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can it for winter use, too.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pumpkin croquettes, not a few,</span><br />
Peter would happily eat;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Knowing content would ensue,&mdash;</span><br />
This is the Pumpkin of Pete.<br />
<br />
Everything went along right,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just as all things ought to do;</span><br />
Till Peter,&mdash;unfortunate wight,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Married a girl that he knew.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each day he had to pursue</span><br />
His runaway Bride down the street,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So her into prison he threw,&mdash;</span><br />
This is the Pumpkin of Pete.<br />

<p>Like the other women present Dinah Craik felt the pathos of the
situation, and gave vent to her feelings in this tender burst of song:</p>
<p class="poem">
Could I come back to you, Peter, Peter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From this old pumpkin that I hate;</span><br />
I would be so tender, so loving, Peter,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peter, Peter, gracious and great.</span><br />
<br />
You were not half worthy of me, Peter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not half worthy the like of I;</span><br />
Now all men beside are not in it, Peter,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peter, Peter, I feel like a pie.</span><br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>Stretch out your hand to me, Peter, Peter,<br />

Peter, my beautiful Pumpkin Eater,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peter, Peter, tender and true.</span><br />
</p>
<p>Mr. Hogg took his own graceful view of the matter, thus:</p>
<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lady of wandering,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Blithesome, meandering,</span><br />
Sweet was thy flitting o'er moorland and lea;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Emblem of restlessness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Blest be thy dwelling place,</span><br />
Oh, to abide in the Pumpkin with thee.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Peter, though bland and good,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Never thee understood,</span><br />
Or he had known how thy nature was free;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Goddess of fickleness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Blest be thy dwelling place,</span><br />
Oh, to abide in the Pumpkin with thee.<br />
</p>
<p>Mr. Kipling grasped at the occasion for a ballad in his best vein. The
plot of the story aroused his old-time enthusiasm, and he transplanted
the pumpkin eater and his wife to the scenes of his earlier powers:</p>
<p class="poem">
In a great big Mammoth pumpkin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lookin' eastward to the sea,</span><br />
There's a wife of mine a-settin'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I know she's mad at me.</span><br />
For I hear her calling, "Peter!"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a wild hysteric shout:</span><br />
"Come you back, you Punkin Eater,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come you back and let me out!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For she's in a punkin shell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I have locked her in her cell;</span><br />
But it really is a comfy, well-constructed punkin shell;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And there she'll have to dwell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For she didn't treat me well,</span><br />
So I put her in the punkin and I've kept her very well.<br />
</p>
<p>Algernon Swinburne was also in one of his early moods, and as a result
he wove the story into this exquisite fabric of words:</p>


<p class="center"><big>IN THE PUMPKIN</big></p>
<p class="poem">
Leave go my hands. Let me catch breath and see,<br />
What is this confine either side of me?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Green pumpkin vines about me coil and crawl,</span><br />
Seen sidelong, like a 'possum in a tree,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah me, ah me, that pumpkins are so small!</span><br />
<br />
Oh, my fair love, I charge thee, let me out<br />
From this gold lush encircling me about;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I turn and only meet a pumpkin wall.</span><br />
The crescent moon shines slim,&mdash;but I am stout,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah me, ah me, that pumpkins are so small!</span><br />
<br />
Pumpkin seeds like cold sea blooms bring me dreams;<br />
Ah, Pete,&mdash;too sweet to me,&mdash;My Pete, it seems<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Love like a Pumpkin holds me in its thrall;</span><br />
And overhead a writhen shadow gleams,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah me, ah me, that pumpkins are so small!</span><br />
</p>
<p>This intense poesy thrilled the heavens, and it was with a sense of
relief to their throbbing souls that they listened to Mr. Bret Harte's
contribution:</p>
<p class="poem">
Which I wish to remark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the lady was plain;</span><br />
And for ways that are dark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And for tricks that are vain</span><br />
She had predilections peculiar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drove Peter nearly insane.</span><br />
<br />
Far off, anywhere,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She wandered each day;</span><br />
And though Peter would swear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lady would stray;</span><br />
And whenever he thought he had got her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She was sure to be rambling away.</span><br />
<br />
Said Peter, "My Wife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hereafter you dwell</span><br />
For the rest of your life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a big Pumpkin Shell."</span><br />
He popped her in one that was handy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And since then he's kept her quite well.</span><br />
<br />
Which is why I remark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though the lady was plain,</span><br />
For ways that are dark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tricks that are vain</span><br />
A husband is very peculiar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the same I am free to maintain.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p><p>Oscar Wilde, in a poetic fervor and a lily-like kimono, recited with
tremulous intensity this masterpiece of his own:</p>
<p class="poem">
Oh, Peter! Pumpkin-fed and proud,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah me; ah me!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Sweet squashes, mother!)</span><br />
Thy woe knells like a stricken cloud;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Ah me; ah me!</span><br />

<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Ah me; ah me!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Faloodle dee!)</span><br />
</p>
<p>There was little to be said after this, so the meeting closed with a
solo by Lady Arthur Hill, sung with a truly touching touch:</p>
<p class="poem">
In the pumpkin, oh, my darling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Think not bitterly of me;</span><br />
Though I went away in silence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though I couldn't set you free.</span><br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>For my heart was filled with longing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For another piece of pie;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Best for you and best for I.</span><br />

To give or not to give, that is the question;<br />

No more; and by that gift to say we end<br />
The Christmas obligations to our friends<br />
We all are heir to! To buy&mdash;to give;<br />
To give&mdash;perchance to get; ay, there's the rub!<br />
For in those bundles gay what frights may come<br />
When we have shuffled off the ribbon bows<br />

Of foolish books and little silver traps,<br />
That make us rather keep the things we buy,<br />

The same old Christmas programme!<br />

<p><span class="dcap">T</span>he Re-Echo Club met in their pleasant rooms at No. 4, Poetic Mews.
Spring had passed, so their fancy was lightly turning to other matters
than Love, and it chanced to turn lightly to the Cubist Movement in Art.</p>

<p>"Of course," mused the President, rolling his eyes in an especially fine
frenzy, "this movement will strike the poets next."</p>

<p>"Ha," said Dan Rossetti, refraining for a moment from the refrain he was
building, "we must be ready for it."</p>

<p>"We must advance to meet it," said Teddy Poe, who was ever of an
adventurous nature. "What's it all about?"</p>

<p>"The principles are simple," observed Rob Browning, glancing from heaven
to earth, from earth to heaven; "in fact, it's much like my own work
always has been. I was born cubic. You see, you just symbolize the
liquefaction of the essence of an idea into its emotional constituents,
and there you are!"</p>

<p>"Dead easy!" declared Lally Tennyson, who went out poeting by the day,
and knew how to do any kind. "What's the subject?"</p>

<p>"That's just the point," said the President; "preeminently and
exclusively it's subjective, and you must keep it so. On no account
allow an object of any kind to creep in. Now, here's one of the Cubist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
pictures. They call it 'A Nude Descending the Staircase.' They pick
names at random out of a hat, I believe. Take this, you fellows, and
throw it into poetry."</p>

<p>"Any rules or conditions?" asked Billy Wordsworth.</p>

<p>"Absolutely none. It's the Ruleless School."</p>

<p>Then the Poets opened the aspiration valves, ignited the divine spark
plugs, and whiz! went their motor-meters in a whirring, buzzing melody.</p>

<p>Soon their Cubist emotions were splashed upon paper, and the Poets read
with justifiable pride these symbolic results.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Ally Swinburne tossed off this poetic gem without a bit of trouble.</p>
<p class="poem">
Square eyelids that hide like a jewel;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ten heads,&mdash;though I sometimes count more;</span><br />
Six mouths that are cubic and cruel;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of mixed arms and legs, twenty-four;</span><br />
Descending in Symbolic glories<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of lissome triangles and squares;</span><br />
Oh, mystic and subtle Dolores,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our Lady of Stairs.</span><br />
<br />
You descend like an army with banners,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a cyclone of wrecked parasols.</span><br />
You look like a mob with mad manners<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or a roystering row of Dutch dolls.</span><br />
Oh, Priestess of Cubical passion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, Deification of Whim,</span><br />
You seem to walk down in the fashion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That lame lobsters swim.</span><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p><p>Here we have Mr. P.B. Shelley's noble lines:</p>
<p class="poem">
Hail to thee, blithe spirit!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nude thou never wert.</span><br />
Not from Heaven nor near it<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Breathed thy cubic heart</span><br />
In profuse stairs of unintelligible art.<br />
<br />
What thou art, we know not;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What is thee most like?</span><br />
Snakes tied in a bow-knot?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stovepipes on a strike?</span><br />
Or Bellevue inmates on a Suffrage hike!<br />
<br />
We look before and after,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pine thy face to see;</span><br />
Our sincerest laughter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is aroused by thee.</span><br />
Art thou perchance the sad cube root of 23?<br />
</p>
<p>Mr. R. Kipling felt a flash of his old fire, and threw in a high speed:</p>
<p class="poem">
On an old symbolic staircase,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Looking forty ways at once;</span><br />
There's a Cubist Nude descending,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the queerest sort of stunts.</span><br />
For the staircase is a-falling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Noodle seems to say:</span><br />
"Though you hear my soul a-calling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You can't see me, anyway!"</span><br />
<br />
Oh, this symbol balderdash,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>And this post-Impression trash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can't you see their paint a-chunkin in a hotchy-potchy splash?</span><br />
Where the motives bold and brash<br />
Of the Cubist painters clash,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Nude descends like thunder down a staircase gone to smash!</span><br />
</p>
<p>Mr. D.G. Rossetti, ever a sweet singer, warbled thus tunefully:</p>
<p class="poem">
The Blessed Nude at eve leaned out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the gold staircase rail;</span><br />
Her paint was deeper than the depth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of waters in a pail.</span><br />
She wore three bonnets on her heads,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And seven coats of mail.</span><br />
<br />
And still she bowed herself and swayed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In circling cubic charms.</span><br />
And the pigments of her painted soul<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were loud as war's alarms.</span><br />
But the staircase lay as if asleep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along her fourteen arms.</span><br />
<br />
(I saw her move!) But soon her path<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was cubes instead of spheres;</span><br />
And then she disappeared among<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The staircase barriers;</span><br />
And, after she was gone, I saw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She'd wept some large paint tears!</span><br />
</p>
<p>Mr. R. Browning found the subject greatly to his liking:</p>
<p class="poem">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>Who will may hear the Staircase story told;<br />
All its blobs, splotches, facets,&mdash;what you will;<br />
The vague Nude, compassed murkily about<br />
With ravage of six long sad hundred stairs,<br />
Dizzily plunging with tumultuous glee!<br />
Whirling the stairdust, hazarding oblique,<br />
The moon safe in her pocket! See she treads<br />
Cool citric crystals, fierce pyropus stone;<br />
While crushing sunbeams in a triple line<br />
Smirk at the insane roses in her hair,<br />
And Strojavacca, frowning, looks asquint<br />
To see that trick of toe,&mdash;that dizened heel,&mdash;<br />
As she, the somewhat, hangs 'twixt naught and naught.<br />
A perfect Then,&mdash;a sub-potential Now&mdash;<br />
A facile and slabsided centipede.<br />
</p>
<p>And here is Mr. B. Jonson's little jingle:</p>
<p class="poem">
Still to be cubed, still to be square,<br />
As you were going down a stair;<br />
Still to see lurid pigments sluiced,&mdash;<br />
Lady, it is to be deduced,<br />
Though art's hid causes are not found,<br />
All is not square, all is not round.<br />
<br />
Give me a cube, give me a line<br />
That makes a whirling maze design;<br />
Robes made of sheet-iron, flowing free,&mdash;<br />
Such sweet device more taketh me<br />
Than masterpieces by old Rubes<br />
Which charm not eyes attuned to cubes.<br />
</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p><p>And Mr. J.W. Riley sang in his usual comforting strain:</p>
<p class="poem">
There, Little Nude, don't cry!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You've descended the stairs, I know;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the weird wild ways</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of the Cubist Jays</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have made you a holy show!</span><br />
But Post Impressions will soon pass by.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There Little Nude, don't cry, don't cry!</span><br />
</p>
<p>Sir A. Tennyson caught the Cubical spirit neatly thus:</p>
<p class="poem">
As the staircase is, the Nude is; thou art painted by a freak.<br />
And I think that he has knocked thee to the middle of next week.<br />
He will paint thee (till this fashion shall expend its foolish force),<br />
Something like a rabid dog,&mdash;a little larger than a horse.<br />
Semblance? Likeness? Scorned of Cubists! This th' evangel that he sings;<br />
Any picture's crown of glory is to look like other things!<br />
So thou art not seen descending in the ordinary way,<br />
But, like fifty motor-cycles, breaking speed laws in Cathay.<br />
</p>
<p>Mr. C. Kingsley was greatly interested:</p>
<p class="poem">
My Cubist Nude, I have no song to give you;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">I could not pipe you, howsoe'er I tried;</span><br />
But ere I go, I wish that you would teach me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Staircase Slide!</span><br />
<br />
Be skittish, child, and let who will be graceful,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do whizzy whirls whenever you've the chance;</span><br />
And so make life, death and that grand old staircase<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One song and dance.</span><br />
</p>
<p>Oscar Wilde was moody and this was his mood:</p>
<p class="poem">
Adown the stairs the Nudelet came;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Pale pink cats up a purple tree!)</span><br />
Hark! to the smitten cubes of flame!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, me! Ah, jamboree!</span><br />
<br />
Her soul seethed in emotions sweet;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Pale pink cats up a purple tree!)</span><br />
Symbolling like a torn-up street;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, jamboree! Ah, me!</span><br />
<br />
And still the Nude's soul-cubes are there,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Pale pink cats up a purple tree!)</span><br />
In writhen glory of despair,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, me! Ah, Hully Gee!</span><br />
</p>
<p>Mr. W. Wordsworth was frankly disdainful:</p>
<p class="poem">
She trod among the untrodden maze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Cubists on a spree;</span><br />
A Nude whom there were none to praise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And very few could see.</span><br />
<br />
A violet 'neath a mossy stone,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quite hidden from the eye,</span><br />
Is far more easy to discern<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than that same Nude to spy.</span><br />
<br />
She lived unseen. Though some few fakes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pretended her to see;</span><br />
But if she's on the stairs, it makes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No difference to me.</span><br />
</p>
<p>Mr. Longfellow fairly let himself go:</p>
<p class="poem">
The picture's done! And the staircase<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Falls like the crash of night.</span><br />
And the Nude is wafted downward<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a catapult in flight.</span><br />
<br />
There's a feeling of strange emotion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That is not akin to art;</span><br />
And resembles a picture only<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As a Tartar resembles a tart.</span><br />
<br />
Such art has power to rouse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our laughter at any time,</span><br />
And comes like electrocution<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That follows after crime.</span><br />
</p>
<p>And Mr. Bunner's poetic gem has a charm all its own:</p>
<p class="poem">
It was an old, old, old, old lady,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a staircase at half-past three;</span><br />
And the way she was painted together<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was beautiful for to see.</span><br />
<br />
She wasn't visible any,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the staircase, no more was he;</span><br />
For it was a Cubist picture<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a feeling of deep skewgee.</span><br />
<br />
'Twas a symbol of soul expression,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though you'd never have known it to be!</span><br />
That emotional old, old lady<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a staircase at half-past three.</span><br />
</p>
<p>Mr. Wordsworth treated the subject boldly, thus:</p>
<p class="poem">
She was a phantom of a fright<br />
When first she burst upon my sight;<br />
A Cubist apparition meant<br />
To symbolize a Nude's descent.<br />
Her eyes like soft-shell crabs aflare<br />
Like loads of brick her dusky hair;<br />
And all things else about her drawn<br />
As by one coming home at dawn.<br />
A fearsome shape, an image fierce,<br />
To haunt, to startle, and to pierce.<br />
I saw her upon nearer view,<br />
Like a symbolic oyster stew;<br />
A countenance in which did meet<br />
The paving blocks from some old street;<br />
The staircase, floating fancy-free,<br />
With steps of Cubic liberty.<br />
A perfect lady, nobly built,<br />
Constructed like a crazy quilt.<br />
Or a volcano on a spree,<br />
Or herd of elephants at tea.<br />
The staircase, by a bombshell wrecked,<br />
With something of a burst effect.<br />
</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p><p>What do you think of A. Dobson's triolet:</p>
<p class="poem">
Oh, see the Nude<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Descend the Stair!</span><br />
Fear not, oh, prude,<br />
To see the Nude;<br />
For by the rood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She isn't there!</span><br />
Oh, see the Nude<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Descend the Stair!</span><br />
</p>
<p>Of course, no one is a sweeter poetess than Miss A.A. Proctor:</p>
<p class="poem">
Seated one day at my easel,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I was hungry and somewhat faint,</span><br />
And my fingers wandered idly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over the tubes of paint.</span><br />
<br />
I know not what I was drawing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or what I was painting there,</span><br />
But I splotched a Cubic Symbol!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a Nude Descending a Stair!</span><br />
<br />
It flooded the crimson canvas<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the gush of a broken dam;</span><br />
And it lay in sticky masses<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like upset gooseberry jam.</span><br />
<br />
It rioted blazing color,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like love ballyragging strife;</span><br />
It seemed the loquacious echo<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of our discordant wife.</span><br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>It linked all Futurist meanings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into one perfect cube,</span><br />
And broke itself up into facets<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a wreck in a Hudson Tube.</span><br />
<br />
I seek, but I seek it vainly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That vast, symbolic line,</span><br />
That came from the head of the staircase<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And entered into mine.</span><br />
<br />
It may be that Pab Picasso<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has painted the thing before,</span><br />
And it may be that only in Bedlam<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I shall paint that Nude some more.</span><br />
</p>
<p>And now the admirers of Mr. Poe will enjoy this:</p>
<p class="poem">
It was many and many a year ago,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a kingdom made of squares,</span><br />
That a Lady lived whom you may know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the Nude Descending the Stairs,</span><br />
And the lady lived with no other home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But those racketty-packetty stairs!</span><br />
<br />
And the moon never beams<br />
Without jarring the seams<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of those cubic triangular stairs;</span><br />
And the earth never quakes<br />
Without bringing the shakes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To those wigglety-wagglety stairs.</span><br />
<br />
And neither the artists in circles above,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or critics who view the d&eacute;bris,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>Can ever dissever the Nude from the Stairs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For both are so hobble-de-gee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So hobble-de-wobble-de-gee!</span><br />
</p>
<p>Mr. A. Tennyson is quite frank in his opinions, and it would seem that
he does not altogether admire the lady:</p>
<p class="poem">
Lady Clara Stair de Stair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of me you shall not win renown.</span><br />
You thought to charm the country's heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As you the staircase tumbled down.</span><br />
<br />
At me you splashed; but unabashed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I saw you in your paint attired;</span><br />
You daughter of a hundred cubes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You are not one to be desired!</span><br />
<br />
Lady Clara Stair de Stair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I care not for these wild &eacute;tudes;</span><br />
A simple Titian in a frame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is worth a hundred Staircase Nudes.</span><br />
<br />
Howe'er it be, it seems to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It isn't noble to be fools;</span><br />
Fine arts are more than Futurists,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And simple lines than Cubist Schools.</span><br />

<p><span class="dcap">A</span>t one meeting of The Re-Echo Club, it chanced that there was no one
present but Omar Khayyam. He had mistaken the date, and came to the
clubroom, only to find it empty. Absent-mindedly, he picked up paper and
pen, and, on leaving, left behind these additional Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t:</p>


<p class="center"><big>RUB&Aacute;IY&Aacute;T OF WALL STREET</big></p>
<p class="poem">
Now the New Hope reviving dying fires,<br />
The Thoughtful Soul to speculate aspires;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the lean Hand of Shylock and his Kin</span><br />
Puts out some Money, which he gladly Hires.<br />
<br />
Myself, when Young, did eagerly Frequent<br />
Broker and Broke; and heard Great Argument<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">About it and about. Yet evermore</span><br />
Came out far Shrewder than when in I went.<br />
<br />
With them the Seed of Wisdom did I sow,<br />
And then I thought I'd sure be in The Know;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And this is all the Wisdom that I gained:</span><br />
If you buy High, Quotations will be Low!<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>Some for the Glories of the System; Some<br />
Sigh for the big Fool's Paradise to come.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, take the Cash, and let the Profits go,</span><br />
Nor heed the Rumble of a Boston Drum!<br />
<br />
The System that with logic absolute<br />
Both Standard Oil and Copper can confute;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Sovereign Alchemist that in a trice</span><br />
National Lead can into Gold transmute.<br />
<br />
Indeed, indeed, at Brokers oft Before<br />
I swore. But was I Cautious when I swore?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then Came Gay State Gas and Rise-in-Hand;</span><br />
I plunged&mdash;and Lost some Fifty Thousand More.<br />
<br />
And then that New Prospectus cast a Spell,<br />
And robbed me of my Hard-Earned Savings. Well,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I often wonder what the Magnates buy</span><br />
One-Half so precious as the Fools they Sell.<br />
<br />
Ah, My Beloved, all Goes up in Smoke!<br />
Last week is past Regret; To-day is a joke;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To-morrow&mdash;why, to-morrow I may be</span><br />
Myself with Yesterday's Seven Thousand Broke!<br />
<br />
You know, My Friends, with what a Brave Carouse<br />
I put a Second Mortgage on my House,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So I could Buy a lot of Copper Shares&mdash;</span><br />
I even used the Savings of my Spouse!<br />
<br />
I sent my Soul down where the Magnates flock<br />
To learn the Truth about some Worthless Stock;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And by and by my Soul returned to me,</span><br />
And answered: "I, myself, have Bought a Block!"<br />
<br />

The Stock that you have Bought Forever Drops!<br />
<br />
And if, in Vain, down on the Stubborn Floor<br />
Of the Exchange you Hazard all your Store,<br />

<br />
Waste not your Money on Expected Gain<br />
Of this or that Provision, Crop or Grain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Better be Jocund with Industrials,</span><br />
Than sadden just Because it Doesn't Rain!<br />
<br />
Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend<br />
Before we, too, into the Pit descend!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dust unto Dust, and without Dust to Live,</span><br />
Sans Stock, sans Bonds, sans Credit and sans Friend.<br />

Moves on. Nor all your Poverty nor Gold<br />

<br />
For I remember stopping in the Jam<br />
To watch a Magnate shearing a Poor Lamb.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with an Eager and Excited Tongue</span><br />
It murmured: "Oh, how Fortunate I am!"<br />
<br />
No book of verses! But a Ticker Tape,<br />
Quotation Record and a Daily Pape;<br />

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
